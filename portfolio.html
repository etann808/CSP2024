    <h3> Our first project that Katelyn and I created is a Magic 8 Ball where a user can input any yes/no questions of their choice and the 8 ball will give a variety of different responses. We were able to create a virtual image of a 8 ball and during the thinking process when
    a user asks a question, the virtual 8 ball will vibrate different colors to signify its thinking. The user can ask as many questions as they would like until they want to stop. </h3>
